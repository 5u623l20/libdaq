Dump Module
===========

The dump DAQ allows you to test the various inline mode features available in
2.9 Snort like injection and normalization.

    ./snort -i <device> --daq dump
    ./snort -r <pcap> --daq dump

By default a file named inline-out.pcap will be created containing all packets
that passed through or were generated by snort.  You can optionally specify a
different name.

    ./snort --daq dump --daq-var file=<name>

The dump DAQ also supports text output of verdicts rendered, injected packets,
and other such items.  In order to enable text output, the 'output' DAQ
variable must be set to either 'text' (text output only) or 'both' (both text
and PCAP output will be written). The default filename for the text output is
inline-out.txt, but it can be overridden like so:

    ./snort --daq dump --daq-var output=text --daq-var text-file=<filename>

dump uses the pcap daq for packet acquisition.  It therefore does not count
filtered packets (a pcap limitation).

Note that the dump DAQ inline mode is not an actual inline mode.  Furthermore,
you will probably want to have the pcap DAQ acquire in another mode like this:

    ./snort -r <pcap> -Q --daq dump --daq-var load-mode=read-file
    ./snort -i <device> -Q --daq dump --daq-var load-mode=passive
